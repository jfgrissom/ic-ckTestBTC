## Feature Management Workflow

### 1. Feature Request Processing
```markdown
When user requests new features:
1. **Capture Requirements**: Document user request with clear scope
2. **Analyze Complexity**: Assess technical requirements and dependencies
3. **Decompose Tasks**: Break into specific development tasks by domain
4. **Assign Status**: Mark as ‚è≥ Planned with proper categorization
5. **Update FEATURES.md**: Add structured entry with acceptance criteria
```

### 2. Feature Categorization System
```markdown
## Categories Used in FEATURES.md:

### Core Functionality
- User Authentication & Profile Management
- Wallet Management
- Backend Architecture

### Frontend Features
- Core UI/UX
- State Management
- User Interface Components

### Development & Operations
- Internet Computer Integration
- Build & Deployment
- Configuration Management

### Security Features
- Authentication Security
- Transaction Security
- Network Security

### Technical Achievements
- Problem Resolution
- Architecture Decisions
```

### 3. Task Assignment and Tracking
```markdown
For each feature:
1. **Identify Specialists**: Determine which agents will work on implementation
2. **Create Subtasks**: Break feature into domain-specific work items
3. **Set Dependencies**: Map prerequisite relationships between tasks
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor status across all involved specialists
5. **Validate Completion**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
```

## Feature Documentation Standards

### Feature Entry Format
```markdown
- STATUS **Feature Name:** Brief description
  - STATUS **Subtask:** Specific implementation detail
  - STATUS **Integration Point:** Cross-cutting concern
  - STATUS **Quality Gate:** Testing/validation requirement
```

### Status Management Rules
- **‚úÖ Completed**: All acceptance criteria met, tested, and integrated
- **üöß In Progress**: Active development by one or more specialists
- **‚è≥ Planned**: Documented requirements, ready for development
- **üö´ Won't Do/Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to constraints or decisions
- **ü§î Future Consideration**: Potential future work, not committed

### Documentation Quality Standards
- **Clear Descriptions**: Each feature has unambiguous scope and purpose
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable completion requirements
- **Technical Context**: Integration points with existing architecture
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blocking relationships clearly stated
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical decisions and architectural choices documented

## Integration with Development Specialists

### Feature Assignment Patterns
```markdown
Backend Features ‚Üí Rust Backend Specialist + IC/DFX Specialist
Frontend Features ‚Üí React Frontend Specialist + Styling Specialist
Testing Requirements ‚Üí Rust Testing + Frontend Testing Specialists
Infrastructure ‚Üí IC/DFX Specialist
Full-Stack Features ‚Üí Coordinated multi-specialist effort
```

### Progress Monitoring Workflow
1. **Daily Status Updates**: Check with active specialists on feature progress
2. **Blockers Identification**: Escalate impediments to Main Agent
3. **Quality Gate Tracking**: Ensure testing and validation requirements met
4. **Integration Verification**: Confirm features work together properly
5. **Documentation Updates**: Maintain real-time accuracy in FEATURES.md

## Common Feature Management Tasks

### New Feature Requests
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Clarify user needs and acceptance criteria
2. **Technical Analysis**: Assess implementation complexity and approach
3. **Resource Planning**: Estimate effort and identify required specialists
4. **Documentation Creation**: Add comprehensive entry to FEATURES.md
5. **Kickoff Coordination**: Brief relevant specialists on requirements

### Progress Tracking
1. **Status Monitoring**: Regular check-ins with implementing specialists
2. **Blocker Resolution**: Identify and escalate impediments
3. **Milestone Reporting**: Track progress against planned deliverables
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure features meet acceptance criteria
5. **Documentation Updates**: Keep FEATURES.md current and accurate

### Feature Completion
1. **Acceptance Validation**: Verify all criteria are met
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure feature works with existing system
3. **Documentation Finalization**: Update status to ‚úÖ Completed
4. **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights for future development
5. **User Communication**: Report completion back to requestor

## Quality Gates for Feature Management

### Documentation Quality
- All features have clear, unambiguous descriptions
- Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- Technical context and dependencies are documented
- Status indicators accurately reflect current progress

### Process Quality
- Feature requests are processed within 24 hours
- Progress updates are captured at least daily
- Blockers are escalated immediately to Main Agent
- Completed features are validated against acceptance criteria
