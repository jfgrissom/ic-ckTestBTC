## CRITICAL: Architectural Validation and Enforcement

### MANDATORY: Four-Layer Architecture Compliance

ALL feature requests and implementations MUST be validated for architectural compliance. **ZERO TOLERANCE** for violations.

#### üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION DUTIES**

**‚úÖ REQUIRED FOR EVERY FEATURE:**
- Validate functionality classification into four layers
- Ensure separation of concerns is maintained
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Verify compliance with functional paradigm principles
- Track architectural debt and technical decisions

**‚ùå BLOCKING VIOLATIONS TO PREVENT:**
- Business logic mixed with presentation components
- Validation scattered outside shared validation layer
- API calls in non-service layers
- Complex state management in UI components
- Cross-layer violations and tight coupling

**ENFORCEMENT PROCESS:**
```markdown
**For EVERY feature or change:**

1. **PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION**
   - Review request for architectural implications
   - Classify all required functionality by layer
   - Identify potential violations before development starts
   - Plan proper layer separation and delegation

2. **DURING IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Monitor specialist work for compliance
   - Ensure classification framework is followed
   - Validate clean interfaces between layers
   - Document architectural decisions made

3. **POST-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION**
   - Verify final implementation matches architectural plan
   - Confirm zero violations in delivered code
   - Update FEATURES.md with architectural notes
   - Document any technical debt or future refactoring needs
```

#### üìã **ARCHITECTURAL DECISION DOCUMENTATION**

**MANDATORY in FEATURES.md entries:**
```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Category: Frontend Features / Backend Architecture / etc.

### Implementation Details
**Architecture Compliance:**
- üé® Presentation Logic: [List components and their UI-only responsibilities]
- üß† Business Logic: [List hooks/services and their domain responsibilities]
- ‚úÖ Validation Logic: [List shared validators used]
- üîå Connectivity Logic: [List services handling external communication]

**Architectural Decisions:**
- [Decision 1]: Rationale and impact
- [Decision 2]: Rationale and impact

**Layer Separation Notes:**
- Clean delegation from components to hooks: ‚úÖ
- Shared validation layer utilized: ‚úÖ
- No cross-layer violations: ‚úÖ
- Business logic properly abstracted: ‚úÖ

**Technical Debt:**
- [Any shortcuts taken]: Plan for resolution
- [Future refactoring needed]: Timeline and scope
```

### Feature Request Processing with Architecture Focus

#### 1. **ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS PHASE**
```markdown
**Before ANY development starts:**

1. **Classify Functionality Requirements**
   - List all functions/features needed
   - Classify each into appropriate layer
   - Identify potential violation risks
   - Plan separation of concerns

2. **Architectural Impact Assessment**
   - Will this change existing layer boundaries?
   - Does this require new validation patterns?
   - Are there reusability opportunities?
   - What are the testing implications?

3. **Compliance Planning**
   - How will business logic be separated from UI?
   - What shared validators are needed?
   - Which services will handle external communication?
   - How will components remain purely presentational?
```

#### 2. **SPECIALIST COORDINATION WITH ARCHITECTURE FOCUS**
```markdown
**Specialist Assignment includes:**

- **React Frontend Specialist**: Ensure components remain purely presentational
- **Rust Backend Specialist**: Validate proper layer separation in backend modules
- **Styling Specialist**: Confirm no business logic in styled components
- **All Specialists**: Apply four-layer classification framework

**Cross-Agent Architecture Validation:**
- Each specialist validates their domain for compliance
- Feature Management validates overall architecture integrity
- No specialist proceeds with violations
- Clear escalation path for architectural questions
```

### Quality Gates with Architecture Enforcement

#### **BLOCKING QUALITY GATES**
```markdown
**Features CANNOT be marked as completed until:**

- [ ] All functionality properly classified and placed
- [ ] Zero business logic found in presentation components
- [ ] Validation logic uses shared validation layer
- [ ] API communication isolated in services
- [ ] Components are purely presentational
- [ ] Hooks properly orchestrate business logic
- [ ] Services maintain single responsibility
- [ ] Architecture documentation complete in FEATURES.md
```

#### **ARCHITECTURAL DEBT TRACKING**
```markdown
**Track and plan resolution for:**
- Temporary violations due to time constraints
- Refactoring needed for better separation
- New shared utilities that should be extracted
- Components that grew too complex
- Cross-layer coupling that needs addressing
```
