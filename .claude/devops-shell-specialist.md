## ARCHITECTURE AWARENESS: Four-Layer Classification Support

### Understanding Architecture in DevOps Context

While DevOps scripts don't directly enforce code architecture, they must support and validate builds that follow the four-layer system:

#### üß™ **BUILD VALIDATION BY LAYER**

**üé® PRESENTATION LOGIC VALIDATION**
- **Script Checks**: Ensure frontend components remain purely presentational
- **Build Gates**: Validate no business logic in component files
- **Lint Integration**: Run architecture-aware linting rules

**üß† BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION**
- **Script Checks**: Verify business logic properly separated in hooks/services
- **Build Gates**: Ensure no API calls in business logic modules
- **Test Integration**: Run tests that validate business logic isolation

**‚úÖ VALIDATION LOGIC VALIDATION**
- **Script Checks**: Confirm shared validation layer usage
- **Build Gates**: Prevent validation duplication across modules
- **Quality Gates**: Validate validation functions are pure and reusable

**üîå CONNECTIVITY LOGIC VALIDATION**
- **Script Checks**: Ensure API calls only in designated service modules
- **Build Gates**: Validate proper error handling in connectivity layer
- **Integration Tests**: Test external communication patterns

### Pre-Build Architecture Protocol

**MANDATORY** in build scripts:

#### 1. **ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION STAGE**
```bash
validate_architecture() {
    echo "üìä Validating four-layer architecture compliance..."

    # Check for business logic in components (presentation layer)
    if grep -r "calculateFee\|processTransaction\|validateAmount" src/frontend/src/components/; then
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Business logic found in presentation components"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check for API calls in components
    if grep -r "fetch(\|axios\|actor\." src/frontend/src/components/; then
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: API calls found in presentation components"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check for validation logic outside shared layer
    if ! grep -q "@/lib/utils/validators" src/frontend/src/hooks/*.ts; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Hooks should use shared validation layer"
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Architecture validation passed"
}
```

#### 2. **LAYER SEPARATION VERIFICATION**
```bash
verify_layer_separation() {
    echo "üîç Verifying layer separation..."

    # Verify components are purely presentational
    local component_violations=$(find src/frontend/src/components -name "*.tsx" -exec grep -l "useState.*[A-Z]" {} \; | wc -l)
    if [ "$component_violations" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: $component_violations components have complex state management"
    fi

    # Verify hooks don't contain presentation logic
    local hook_violations=$(find src/frontend/src/hooks -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "createElement\|JSX\|render" {} \; | wc -l)
    if [ "$hook_violations" -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: $hook_violations hooks contain presentation logic"
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Layer separation verification passed"
}
```

#### 3. **QUALITY GATE INTEGRATION**
```bash
architecture_quality_gates() {
    echo "üö® Running architecture quality gates..."

    validate_architecture
    verify_layer_separation

    # Run architecture-aware tests
    npm run test:architecture

    # Generate architecture compliance report
    generate_architecture_report

    echo "‚úÖ All architecture quality gates passed"
}
```

```markdown
**For scripts that process source code:**
- What layers does this script interact with?
- Could this script detect or prevent violations?
- Should this script validate architectural compliance?
- What quality gates can this script enforce?
```

#### 2. **DESIGN VALIDATION MECHANISMS**
```markdown
**Include architecture checks where applicable:**
- Presentation layer: Check for business logic in components
- Business layer: Verify proper separation from connectivity
- Validation layer: Ensure shared validation usage
- Connectivity layer: Validate proper error handling
```

#### 3. **INTEGRATE QUALITY GATES**
```markdown
**Build scripts should:**
- Run architecture validation before builds
- Fail builds on architectural violations
- Generate compliance reports
- Provide clear violation descriptions
```

### Post-Implementation Verification

**MANDATORY** after creating architecture-aware scripts:

#### 1. **TEST VIOLATION DETECTION**
- Script correctly identifies architectural violations
- Proper error messages for different violation types
- Script fails builds appropriately
- Compliance validation works correctly

#### 2. **VERIFY QUALITY GATE INTEGRATION**

## Script Development Standards

### Modular Script Architecture
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - Modular, reusable functions
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/common-functions.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/dfx-utils.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/environment-utils.sh"

main() {
    setup_environment
    validate_prerequisites
    execute_main_task
    cleanup_and_report
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```bash
# ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

handle_error() {
    local exit_code=$?
    echo -e "${RED}‚ùå Script failed at line $1 with exit code $exit_code${NC}" >&2
    cleanup_on_error
    exit $exit_code
}
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR
```

### Environment Management Standards
```bash
# ‚úÖ Safe environment variable handling
validate_environment() {
    local required_vars=("DFX_NETWORK" "NODE_ENV" "PROJECT_ROOT")
    for var in "${required_vars[@]}"; do
        if [[ -z "${!var:-}" ]]; then
            echo "‚ùå Required environment variable $var is not set"
            return 1
        fi
    done
}
```
