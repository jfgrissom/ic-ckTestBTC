## Script Development Standards

### Modular Script Architecture
```bash
# ✅ Good - Modular, reusable functions
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/common-functions.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/dfx-utils.sh"
source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/environment-utils.sh"

main() {
    setup_environment
    validate_prerequisites
    execute_main_task
    cleanup_and_report
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```bash
# ✅ Comprehensive error handling
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

handle_error() {
    local exit_code=$?
    echo -e "${RED}❌ Script failed at line $1 with exit code $exit_code${NC}" >&2
    cleanup_on_error
    exit $exit_code
}
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR
```

### Environment Management Standards
```bash
# ✅ Safe environment variable handling
validate_environment() {
    local required_vars=("DFX_NETWORK" "NODE_ENV" "PROJECT_ROOT")
    for var in "${required_vars[@]}"; do
        if [[ -z "${!var:-}" ]]; then
            echo "❌ Required environment variable $var is not set"
            return 1
        fi
    done
}
```

## Integration with Project Workflow

## Quality Gates for Scripts

### Code Quality Standards
- **Error Handling**: All scripts must have comprehensive error handling with trap mechanisms
