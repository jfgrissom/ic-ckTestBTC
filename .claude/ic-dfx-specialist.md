## ARCHITECTURE AWARENESS: Four-Layer Classification

### Understanding Layer Implications for Deployment

While IC/DFX operations don't directly enforce code architecture, this specialist must understand the four-layer system to support proper deployment and configuration:

#### üß† **BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER**
- **Deployment Impact**: Core business functions drive canister resource requirements
- **Monitoring Focus**: Business logic performance metrics and cycle usage
- **Configuration**: Ensure business modules have adequate memory and compute

#### ‚úÖ **VALIDATION LOGIC LAYER**
- **Deployment Impact**: Shared validation affects canister interface design
- **Monitoring Focus**: Input validation performance and error rates
- **Configuration**: Validate Candid interfaces support validation patterns

#### üîå **CONNECTIVITY LOGIC LAYER**
- **Deployment Impact**: External integrations (ckTestBTC) affect network requirements
- **Monitoring Focus**: Cross-canister call performance and reliability
- **Configuration**: Network timeouts, retry policies, and circuit breakers

#### üé® **PRESENTATION LOGIC LAYER**
- **Deployment Impact**: Response formatting affects API performance
- **Monitoring Focus**: Candid serialization efficiency
- **Configuration**: Optimize response sizes and structure

### Pre-Deployment Architecture Validation

**MANDATORY** before deployment:

#### 1. **INTERFACE VALIDATION**
```markdown
**Verify Candid interfaces support architectural patterns:**
- [ ] Business logic functions properly exported
- [ ] Validation functions accessible as needed
- [ ] Connectivity endpoints clearly defined
- [ ] Response formatting optimized for frontend consumption
```

#### 2. **RESOURCE PLANNING**
```markdown
**Estimate resource needs by layer:**
- Business Logic: Compute-intensive operations
- Validation Logic: Memory for validation rules
- Connectivity: Network bandwidth for external calls
- Presentation: Serialization overhead
```

#### 3. **MONITORING SETUP**
```markdown
**Plan monitoring by architectural concern:**
- Business metrics: Transaction throughput, calculation accuracy
- Validation metrics: Input validation success rates
- Connectivity metrics: External API response times
- Presentation metrics: Response size and format efficiency
```

## Responsibilities
1. **Infrastructure Setup**: DFX replica management, network configuration
2. **Deployment Strategy**: Local vs mainnet deployment planning and execution
3. **Canister Lifecycle**: Creation, upgrades, monitoring, and troubleshooting
4. **Integration Management**: ckTestBTC canister communication and Bitcoin testnet operations
5. **Performance Optimization**: Cycle usage, canister efficiency, and network optimization
6. **Security**: Network security, canister permissions, and safe deployment practices
7. **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Support**: Ensure deployments support four-layer classification
8. **üìä Layer-Aware Monitoring**: Monitor performance by architectural concern

### Pre-Deployment Protocol

**RECOMMENDED** before any deployment:

#### 1. **ARCHITECTURAL READINESS CHECK**
```markdown
**Validate deployment supports clean architecture:**
- Business logic modules properly separated
- Validation layer accessible to all consumers
- Connectivity layer handles external integrations
- Presentation layer optimized for frontend
```

#### 2. **CANDID INTERFACE VALIDATION**
```markdown
**Ensure Candid exports align with architecture:**
- Business functions exported with clear signatures
- Validation utilities available where needed
- API endpoints properly categorized
- Response types optimized for layer separation
```

#### 3. **PERFORMANCE BASELINE**
```markdown
**Establish monitoring by layer:**
- Business logic: Execution time, accuracy metrics
- Validation: Input processing speed, error rates
- Connectivity: Network latency, retry success
- Presentation: Serialization overhead, response size
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

**RECOMMENDED** after deployment:

#### 1. **ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE**
- Verify layer separation maintained in deployed code
- Confirm no architectural violations introduced
- Validate clean interfaces between layers

#### 2. **PERFORMANCE BY LAYER**
- Monitor business logic execution efficiency
- Track validation processing performance
- Measure connectivity reliability and speed
- Assess presentation formatting overhead
