# Code Review Checklist & Quality Gate Mechanisms

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive code review guidelines and quality gate mechanisms to enforce the four-layer architecture classification and prevent violations across the codebase.

## Pre-Review Architecture Classification

### MANDATORY: Layer Classification Check

Before reviewing ANY code, classify all new/modified functionality:

#### üé® **PRESENTATION LOGIC (Components Only)**
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED:
- JSX rendering and UI composition
- User interaction handling (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
- Local UI state (modals open/closed, hover, focus states)
- Visual feedback and animations
- Event delegation to parent components via props
- Conditional rendering based on props

‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
- API calls or data fetching (fetch, axios, backend actor calls)
- Business calculations (fees, balances, conversions, formatting)
- Validation logic beyond "field not empty" checks
- Amount conversions or mathematical operations
- Data transformation or processing
- Complex state management with multiple useState/useMemo
- Direct backend communication
```

#### üß† **BUSINESS LOGIC (Hooks + Services)**
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED:
- Data processing and transformations
- Domain calculations (fees, conversions, balances)
- Workflow orchestration and complex state management
- Transaction preparation and formatting
- Data aggregation and statistics

‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
- UI rendering or JSX elements
- Direct DOM manipulation
- Component-specific styling or layout
- Event handler implementations for UI
```

#### ‚úÖ **VALIDATION LOGIC (Shared Layer: @/lib/utils/validators/)**
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED:
- Input sanitization and constraint checking
- Business rule enforcement
- Data integrity verification
- Security validation (address formats, amount limits)
- Cross-field validation dependencies

‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
- Business calculations or transformations
- API communication or external calls
- UI rendering or presentation logic
- Complex workflow orchestration
```

#### üîå **CONNECTIVITY LOGIC (Services Only)**
```markdown
‚úÖ ALLOWED:
- Backend actor management and canister calls
- API communication and HTTP requests
- Network error handling and retry logic
- Data serialization/deserialization for external systems

‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
- Business calculations or domain logic
- Input validation or sanitization
- UI rendering or presentation logic
- Complex data processing beyond serialization
```

## Code Review Quality Gates

### BLOCKING VIOLATIONS (Fail Review Immediately)

#### üö® **SEVERE VIOLATIONS** - Immediate Build Failure
```markdown
‚ùå Business logic found in React components:
   - Mathematical operations (*, +, -, /, %)
   - Fee calculations, balance transformations
   - Amount formatting or conversion
   - Complex conditional business rules

‚ùå API calls in components or hooks (non-service):
   - fetch(), axios, or backend actor calls
   - Direct canister communication
   - External API integration

‚ùå Validation logic scattered outside shared layer:
   - Inline validation in components
   - Validation logic in business hooks
   - Duplicate validation patterns
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY VIOLATIONS** - Require Immediate Fix
```markdown
‚ùå Complex state management in components:
   - Multiple useState hooks for business data
   - useEffect for data fetching in components
   - Business logic mixed with UI logic

‚ùå Presentation logic in hooks/services:
   - JSX elements returned from hooks
   - UI-specific formatting in services
   - Component-specific logic in business layer
```

#### üìã **MODERATE VIOLATIONS** - Must Fix Before Merge
```markdown
‚ùå Validation duplication:
   - Same validation logic in multiple files
   - Business rules not using shared validators
   - Inconsistent validation patterns

‚ùå Layer boundary violations:
   - Business logic calling presentation functions
   - Connectivity mixed with business calculations
   - Validation embedded in connectivity layer
```

### Review Process by File Type

#### React Component Files (*.tsx)
```markdown
1. **Presentation Logic Verification**
   - [ ] Component only contains JSX and UI logic
   - [ ] All business logic delegated via props or hooks
   - [ ] No mathematical operations or calculations
   - [ ] No API calls or external communication
   - [ ] No validation logic beyond empty checks

2. **Prop Interface Review**
   - [ ] Clear separation between data props and action props
   - [ ] All business actions delegated via callback props
   - [ ] No complex business types embedded in props

3. **State Management Review**
   - [ ] Only UI state in component (loading, open/closed, etc.)
   - [ ] No business data stored in component state
   - [ ] No complex useEffect patterns for data fetching

BLOCKING PATTERNS:
- calculateFee, processTransaction, validateAmount functions

- Validation logic outside shared layer
- Require fix before merge approval

#### **Level 3: Moderate Violations**

- Address in future refactoring cycles

### Review Escalation Process
1. **Reviewer identifies violation** ‚Üí Document severity and required changes
2. **Developer fixes violations** ‚Üí Re-submit for architecture validation
3. **Persistent violations** ‚Üí Escalate to Feature Management Specialist
4. **Architecture questions** ‚Üí Consult React Frontend or Rust Backend Specialists
5. **Policy clarifications** ‚Üí Update this checklist and inform all agents

## Success Metrics

### Violation Prevention
- **Zero Critical Violations**: No business logic in components
- **Zero API Violations**: No API calls outside services
- **Shared Validation Usage**: >90% of validation uses shared layer
- **Clean Layer Separation**: Each layer maintains single responsibility

### Review Efficiency
- **Review Time**: Average time to identify architectural issues
- **Fix Time**: Time from violation identification to resolution
- **Prevention Rate**: Percentage of violations caught in review vs production
- **Pattern Consistency**: Consistency of architectural patterns across codebase

This comprehensive review system ensures strict adherence to the four-layer architecture while providing clear guidance for developers and reviewers.
