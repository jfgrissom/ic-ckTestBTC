  - ✅ **BigInt Decimal Conversion Bug:** Fixed "Cannot convert .5 to a BigInt" errors
    - ✅ **Root Cause:** Direct BigInt conversion of decimal user inputs (e.g., "0.5", ".5") was failing
    - ✅ **Solution Implementation:** Added proper decimal-to-satoshi conversion before BigInt conversion
    - ✅ **Files Fixed:** `wallet.service.ts`, `icp.service.ts`, `deposit-withdrawal.service.ts`
    - ✅ **Pattern Applied:** `Math.floor(Number(amount) * 100000000)` before `BigInt()` conversion
    - ✅ **Impact:** Users can now enter decimal amounts like "0.5" and ".123" without errors
  - ✅ **Block Index Display Bug:** Fixed "[object Object]" display instead of proper error messages
    - ✅ **Root Cause:** Error objects being treated as block indices and converted to strings
    - ✅ **Solution Implementation:** Proper error detection before treating result as success
    - ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added `'Err' in result` checks before processing success cases
    - ✅ **Impact:** Users now see proper error messages like "Insufficient funds. Balance: 0 satoshis"
  - ✅ **Balance Discrepancy Discovery:** Identified fundamental architecture mismatch
    - ✅ **Issue Found:** Frontend shows 2 ckTestBTC balance but backend reports 0 satoshis during transfer
    - ✅ **Root Cause Analysis:** Non-custodial architecture vs intended custodial wallet model
    - ✅ **Backend Logs Analysis:** 200,000,000 satoshis available but transfer from user principal fails
    - ✅ **Next Phase Identified:** Need custodial architecture with backend as fund custodian

### Architecture Decisions

  local development
- ✅ **Transaction History:** Complete persistent transaction history
  implemented
- 🤔 **Multi-Asset Support:** Only ckTestBTC currently supported

  - ✅ **Hook Directory Structure:** Refactored to follow project standards
    - ✅ All hooks moved from direct `.ts` files to directory-per-module
      structure
    - ✅ Kebab-case naming convention: `use-auth/index.ts`,
      `use-wallet/index.ts`, etc.
    - ✅ Updated all imports throughout codebase to use new directory structure
  - ✅ **Service Layer Architecture:** Functional service modules with closure-based
    state management
    - ✅ Services provide functional modules with closure-based state for backend actor management
    - ✅ Clear separation between functional React components and functional
      service modules
    - ✅ Type-safe integration with auto-generated backend declarations

### Four-Layer Architecture Classification Framework (2025-01-17)

- ✅ **Comprehensive Architecture Enforcement:** Implementation of strict four-layer classification system
  - ✅ **Presentation Logic (🎨):** Components remain purely presentational with zero business logic
  - ✅ **Business Logic (🧠):** Hooks and services handle domain calculations and workflow orchestration
  - ✅ **Validation Logic (✅):** Shared validation layer prevents duplication and ensures consistency
  - ✅ **Connectivity Logic (🔌):** Services handle all external communication with proper error handling

#### Implementation Details
**Architecture Compliance:**
- 🎨 Presentation Logic: All React components refactored to be purely presentational, delegating business actions via props
- 🧠 Business Logic: Custom hooks properly orchestrate domain logic without external calls or validation
- ✅ Validation Logic: Comprehensive shared validation layer at `@/lib/utils/validators/` with established libraries (@dfinity/principal, validator.js)
- 🔌 Connectivity Logic: Service modules handle all API communication with proper error handling and retry logic

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **Shared Validation Layer**: Created centralized validation to prevent code duplication and ensure consistent validation patterns across the application
- **Component Purity Enforcement**: Established zero-tolerance policy for business logic in components to maintain clean separation of concerns
- **Service Layer Delegation**: Implemented proper delegation patterns where components pass actions to hooks, hooks orchestrate business logic, and services handle external communication

**Layer Separation Notes:**
- Clean delegation from components to hooks: ✅
- Shared validation layer utilized: ✅
- No cross-layer violations: ✅
- Business logic properly abstracted: ✅
