## Problem Resolution Log

- ✅ **Internet Identity Setup:** Resolved complex local development setup with automated error resolution, including fixing 503 errors by automatically detecting and installing missing WASM modules.
- ✅ **ckTestBTC Local Development:** Overcame mainnet canister integration challenges by creating a standardized mock canister architecture (`mock_cktestbtc_*`) and implementing smart environment detection.
- ✅ **DFX Candid Generation Bug:** Implemented a comprehensive, multi-layered solution to a critical DFX toolchain bug by integrating `candid-extractor`, manual TypeScript binding generation, and a verification system to bypass `dfx generate` limitations.
- ✅ **Frontend Build System:** Configured Vite and TypeScript to work seamlessly with Internet Computer canister development, including environment variable management and asset canister integration.
- ✅ **Environment Variable Persistence Issue:** Solved a critical development workflow stability problem by storing environment variables persistently in `dfx.json`, ensuring they survive DFX restarts without manual intervention.
- ✅ **Browser Extension Error Resolution:** Implemented an intelligent error classification and filtering system to prevent common browser extension errors (e.g., `inject.js`) from disrupting the user experience or cluttering logs.
- ✅ **UI Display Bug Resolution:** Fixed a double-conversion error in balance formatting by creating a standardized, shared utility for all satoshi-to-ckTestBTC conversions, establishing a single-point-of-conversion architecture.
- ✅ **Principal Validation Enhancement:** Replaced a simplistic and faulty regex-based Principal ID validation with a robust, shared utility using the official `@dfinity/principal` library.
- ✅ **Development Environment Cleanup:** Removed all debug `console.log` statements from the production codebase to improve performance and developer experience.
- ✅ **Direct Ledger Integration Architecture:** Refactored the transaction model to use direct frontend-to-ledger communication, resolving a critical `InsufficientFunds` error caused by a backend proxy pattern and ensuring ICRC-1 standard compliance.
- ✅ **Bitcoin Testnet Deposit Address Implementation:** Built the complete pipeline for TestBTC to ckTestBTC conversion by integrating the backend with the ckTestBTC minter canister.
- ✅ **Critical Security Fix: Bitcoin Address Collision Vulnerability:** Eliminated a major fund misallocation risk by ensuring each user principal generates a unique Bitcoin testnet deposit address using ICRC-1 subaccounts.
- ✅ **Custodial Wallet Architecture Implementation:** Implemented a full custodial fund management system, allowing users to view both personal and custodial balances and deposit funds between them, aligning the architecture with project requirements.
- ✅ **Self-Transfer Detection Debug Enhancement:** Added comprehensive logging to the transfer function to better diagnose issues with principal comparisons that were causing false self-transfer errors.
- ✅ **User-to-User Transfer Implementation:** Enabled direct principal-to-principal ckTestBTC transfers using the backend's ICRC-1 compliant `transfer` function.
- ✅ **Custodial Deposit InsufficientFunds Regression Fix:** Resolved a critical deposit failure by migrating to Connect2IC v2 and re-implementing a direct-ledger deposit pattern, restoring PRD compliance. This involved a major refactor of the authentication and service layers.
- ✅ **Critical Transfer Bug Resolution:** Fixed BigInt conversion errors for decimal inputs and corrected error display logic to show meaningful messages instead of `[object Object]`.

## Architectural Decisions & Improvements

- ✅ **Separation of Concerns:** Implemented a clean architecture where the backend canister handles blockchain interactions and the frontend focuses on the user interface.
- ✅ **Technology Stack:** Chose a modern, performant stack including Rust, React/TypeScript, Vite, and Internet Identity. Utilized `candid-extractor` and shell scripting to create a robust and reliable build system.
- ✅ **Four-Layer Architecture Classification Framework (2025-01-17):** Enforced a strict four-layer system (Presentation, Business, Validation, Connectivity) to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.
- ✅ **Service Layer Refactoring to Functional Paradigm (2025-01-17):** Migrated all services from a class-based singleton pattern to a more modern, testable, and tree-shakeable functional module pattern with closure-based state.
- ✅ **Enhanced Development Agent Ecosystem:** Updated all AI agent personas with awareness of the four-layer architecture to ensure compliance in future development.
- ✅ **Quality Gate Implementation:** Established an architecture-aware code review process with checklists and automated validation to prevent architectural violations.
- ✅ **Documentation Reorganization:** Improved documentation structure by separating project-wide concerns from frontend-specific guidelines and documenting the new functional service layer pattern.
